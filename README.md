# üìÅ FileShare: Accessible & Accountable File Storage for Everyone

The **goal** of this project is to build a file-sharing and storage platform that serves not just tech-savvy users, but **older people**, **non-technical users**, **organizations**, and **groups of people** who may struggle with overly complex or abstract systems.  
Our guiding principle is simple:

> Make storing and accessing files as easy as possible for *everyone* ‚Äî even those who have never used Dropbox or Google Drive ‚Äî while also empowering *staff* to keep things safe, clean, and organized.

This is **not** just another cloud app. This is a purpose-driven platform built with clarity, security, and **human simplicity** in mind.

## üß† The Philosophy Behind It

Most modern file-sharing systems assume too much of the user: that they know what "cloud" means, how to manage file permissions, how to troubleshoot login issues, or how to install apps.  
But we live in a world where many users ‚Äî particularly **seniors**, **community centers**, **grassroots groups**, or **people with limited tech literacy** ‚Äî don't want bells and whistles. They just want:

- "Where are my files?"  
- "How do I upload a photo?"  
- "How can I share this with my friend?"  

That's what **FileShare** solves.

At the same time, we recognize that in any shared space, there must be **rules**, and someone must be able to **enforce them**.  
That's where the **staff role** comes in. Staff members can monitor folder sharing, delete content that violates policies, and assist users by resetting passwords, verifying issues, and handling abuse reports ‚Äî all within the same platform.

## üß∞ Feature Overview

### üîê Authentication
- **JWT-based login system** with email and password.  
- **Role management**: user, staff, and owner (admin-level).  
- **MongoDB integration** to persist user records.  
- **Password recovery** via email and secure reset mechanism.  
- **One-time-password (OTP) login** flow.

### üóÇÔ∏è Folder Management
- Users can **create folders**.  
- Files can be **uploaded, viewed, downloaded, and deleted**.  
- **Export folder as ZIP** (`/api/export-as-zip/:folderId`).  
- **Public/private toggle** for folders.  
- **Audit log** of every action.

### üë• Sharing & Collaboration
- Invite friends by email to collaborate on a folder.  
- Friends get view/download/upload/delete/addUsers permissions as configured.  
- **Group sharing**: create groups, invite members, assign folder permissions.  
- **Staff moderation**: staff can view and remove invitations, friends, groups.

### üñºÔ∏è Thumbnail Generation
- **Image thumbnails** (`/api/thumbnail/:folderId/:filename`) via Sharp.  
- **Video thumbnails** via FFmpeg + Sharp.

### üîó Temporary Download Links
- **Token-based download** for public/non-public folders (`/api/download-file?token=...`).  
- **Owner-generated presigned S3 links** valid for 1‚Äì24 hours (`/api/make-a-temporary-download-link`).

### ü§ñ AI & Utility Endpoints
- **AI-driven recommendations**: `/api/recommended-files`.  
- **AI-powered content safety review** (periodic, email to owner).  
- **Random cat image** endpoint: `/api/curl/cats`.
- **Health check**: `/api/health`.

### üìä Staff & Analytics

  `/api/staff/stats/total-users`  
  `/api/staff/stats/total-folders`  
  `/api/staff/stats/total-public-folders`
