# 📁 FileShare: Accessible & Accountable File Storage for Everyone

The **goal** of this project is to build a file‑sharing and storage platform that serves not just tech‑savvy users, but **older people**, **non‑technical users**, **organizations**, and **groups of people** who may struggle with overly complex or abstract systems.  
Our guiding principle is simple:

> Make storing and accessing files as easy as possible for *everyone* — even those who have never used Dropbox or Google Drive — while also empowering *staff* to keep things safe, clean, and organized.

This is **not** just another cloud app. This is a purpose‑driven platform built with clarity, security, and **human simplicity** in mind.

## 🧠 The Philosophy Behind It

Most modern file‑sharing systems assume too much of the user: that they know what "cloud" means, how to manage file permissions, how to troubleshoot login issues, or how to install apps.  
But we live in a world where many users — particularly **seniors**, **community centers**, **grassroots groups**, or **people with limited tech literacy** — don't want bells and whistles. They just want:

* "Where are my files?"  
* "How do I upload a photo?"  
* "How can I share this with my friend?"  

That's what **FileShare** solves.

At the same time, we recognize that in any shared space, there must be **rules**, and someone must be able to **enforce them**.  
That's where the **staff role** comes in. Staff members can monitor folder sharing, delete content that violates policies, and assist users by resetting passwords, verifying issues, and handling abuse reports — all within the same platform.

## 🧰 Feature Overview

### 🔐 Authentication
* **JWT‑based login system** with email and password.  
* **Role management**: user, staff, and owner (admin‑level).  
* **MongoDB integration** to persist user records.  
* **Password recovery** via email and secure reset mechanism.  

### 🗂️ Folder Management
* Users can **create folders**.  
* Files can be **uploaded, viewed, and deleted**.  
* Folders can be **shared with friends** via invitation email.  
* View contents in a clean UI with file sizes and timestamps.  

### 👥 Sharing & Collaboration
* Invite friends by email to collaborate on a folder.  
* Friends get view and download access, but not delete control.  
* Invitations are sent via email with accept/deny links.  
* Staff can monitor and manage invitations globally.  

### 🧑‍💼 Staff Tools
Staff users can:  

* View all pending invitations across the system.  
* Remove users from shared folders.  
* View metadata of folder contents.  
* Flag or delete folders that violate policy.  
* Look up user accounts and reset passwords.  
* Read recent entries in the audit log (no attachments).  

This helps **organizations keep their shared spaces clean, abuse‑free, and legally compliant**.

### 📝 Audit Logging
Every action a user takes is logged:

* Register  
* Login  
* Upload file  
* Create folder  
* Share folder  
* Staff actions  

All logs are saved to `audit.log` in JSON format, readable by staff via API. This is crucial for traceability and security.

## 🧑‍🔧 Technical Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js + Fastify  
* **Database:** MongoDB (hosted or local)  
* **Frontend:** Static HTML, CSS (Bulma), JavaScript  
* **File storage:** AWS S3 (cloud-based file storage)  
* **Email:** Nodemailer via SMTP (supports Gmail, Proton, etc.)  

---

## 🧰 Technical Changes

### **File Storage: AWS S3 Integration**
* The file storage system has been updated to use **AWS S3** instead of the local file system. This change improves scalability and makes it easier to manage large files.

### **Folder Contents Listing**
* Files in folders are now listed using the **AWS S3 API** with `listObjectsV2`. This allows users to see their file metadata (size, timestamp, type) without accessing local storage.

### **Uploading Files to S3**
* Files are uploaded directly to **AWS S3** using `s3.upload()` instead of being written to the local filesystem.

### **Downloading and Viewing Files**
* Files are downloaded via the **AWS S3 API** using `getObject()` and can be streamed directly to the client.
