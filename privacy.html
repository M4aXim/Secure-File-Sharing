          <p>At <strong>FileShare</strong>, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and under what circumstances it may be reviewed or disclosed.</p>

          <h2 class="title is-5">1. What Data We Collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Username, email address, and encrypted password used for login and authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Uploaded Files:</strong> The content you upload to our service is stored securely on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the platform, including IP addresses and timestamps.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="title is-5">2. How Your Data is Used</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide and operate our file sharing service securely.</li>
            <li>To allow user authentication and account management.</li>
            <li>To monitor for potential violations of our <a href="TOS.html">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
            <li>To improve security, detect abuse, and protect the platform from misuse.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="title is-5">3. No Data Selling or Advertising</h2>
          <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third party for marketing, advertising, or profiling purposes. Your data stays within the FileShare ecosystem unless legally required to disclose it.</p>

          <h2 class="title is-5">4. Data Access and Review</h2>
          <p>We respect your privacy and do not actively monitor user-uploaded files or personal content. However, we reserve the right to review user data under the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If we receive a report or detect behavior that suggests a user is violating the Terms of Service (e.g., uploading illegal material or attempting to attack the service).</li>
            <li>If required to do so by law enforcement or court order.</li>
            <li>As part of an internal investigation into abuse, security threats, or prohibited conduct.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In such cases, our team may individually review files, logs, and account activity to determine if violations have occurred. This is done solely to maintain the integrity and safety of the platform.</p>

          <h2 class="title is-5">5. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide you with our services or comply with legal obligations. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time, and we will honor such requests unless we are required to preserve the data for legal reasons.</p>

          <h2 class="title is-5">6. Your Rights</h2>
          <p>You have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Request access to the personal data we hold about you</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate or outdated information</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your data (subject to conditions above)</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent for data processing where applicable</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="title is-5">7. Data Security</h2>
          <p>We use encryption, secure access controls, and best practices to protect your data. While no system can be 100% secure, we strive to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.</p>

          <h2 class="title is-5">8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
          <p>This policy may be updated from time to time. We will update the effective date at the top of the page and notify users of any material changes. Continued use of the service after changes are published implies agreement with the updated terms.</p>
